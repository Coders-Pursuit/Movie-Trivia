* Assign an MVP and everything above that is a stretch goal.
    * Stretch goals are the first to get cut
    * MVP if behind will put in extra hours as necessary
* Asyncronis work

## Work Plan

Planning tool would be trello.com/kanban.
* Volunteer basis for initial assigning of tasks
    * No volunteers, it will get assigned or removed
* Pair programming as a default
    * worst case siloed to complete tasks
* two peer review prior to merging with the working branch

## Git Process 

Everything related to the project will live on github and a link to the trello board. Repository will be organization based.

Git flow will be main as a final branch, all work will be submitted to the staging branch, as features are created, a branch will be created.

Pull requests will be reviewed by non coding pair and branches will be merged by the coding pair. 

So, merging will be accomplished on a 3 time loop, coding will be accomplished in the first hour and review will be completed after the break and  merged at the end of the day or 3 hour block.
